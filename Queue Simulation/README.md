# Queue Simulation

## Airport Security Check
3 X-Ray machines. Average of 400 passengers to be checked every hour (arrival time follows exponential distribution). Every X-Ray machine can check 150 passengers every hour. 10% of passengers must go through manual luggage checking after the X-Ray check, where 3 officers are responsible for this check. Manual checking follows a normal distribution with mean of 4 minutes and standard deviation of 2 minutes.
(1) Estimate the average time to pass through the security check.
(2) Estimate the average time if there is no manual check.
(3) Which way is better to shorten the average time, add one X-Ray machine or one officer ?

## Metro Security Check
Average time of check for one person is 10 seconds. There are 4 officers on duty. Assume there are 1000 passengers to be checked every hour, estimate the average time needed for one person to pass through the security check.
